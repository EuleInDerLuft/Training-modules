# Introduction to Python

## Description
Python is a powerful open source programming language for many applications. In this 3 hour, hands-on workshop, we will teach basic topics related to Python programming. The materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.

## Course objectives
This course covers most foundamental knowledge of Python, including:
- Learn basic Python syntax
- Create and manipulation Python list
- Use internal functions, and define user-specific functions
- Apply conditional statements
By the end of this course, students should be able to create Python scripts and perform some simple tasks. The course also set foundatation for learning advanced topics of Python.

## Requirements
To complete this course, you will need a computer and a Google account (to assess Colab). **Installation of Python or any other tools is not needed for this course.**

## Who should attend this course
You will find this course helpful, if you:
- Have no/little background in computer programming, and would like to start learning a programming language
- Have some knowledge in other programming languages (for example, R), but would like to learn and apply Python
- Have sparsely learnt Python somewhere preveiously, but would like to quickly pick up fundamental concepts, and prepare for more in-depth learning
> Note: while this course is developed with teaching life science researchers in mind, it can be used for students of any technical background.

## Who should NOT attend this course
You may find this course not that helpful, if you:
- Have tremendous experiences in Python programming already, and are looking for tutorials of more advanced topics
> Note: we might be developing more advanced topics of Python based on general interest, so stay tuned!
